Hello new programmer welcome to my learning platform, 
we are going to learn many random program to make goods enough to code like a pro


import os, time

"""Program to find the file in current location and print the size, creation time, modification time, and accessed 
time """


def file(file_path):
    """Function to find the file in current path"""
    if os.path.isfile(file_path):
        print('Your File is exists')
        file_info = os.stat(file_path)
        print('Size: ', convert(file_info.st_size))
        print('Date created: ' + time.ctime(file_info.st_ctime))
        print('Date modified: ' + time.ctime(file_info.st_mtime))
        print('Date accessed: ' + time.ctime(file_info.st_atime))

        return
    else:
        print('Your file does\'t exit on current location: ', file_path)


def convert(size):
    """ Function to convert the appropriate size in bytes/KB/MB/GB/TB """
    for x in ['bytes', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB']:
        if size < 1024:  # if the unit is less than return the appropriate unit
            return '%3.1f%s' % (size, x)
        size /= 1024  # to get the unit


folder_path = input('Please give the folder path to find the file: ')
file_name = input('Please give the file name: ')
path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)
file(path)
